# Retina by *Deepmagic*
In case you guys were didn't know.  This README.md is github flavored markdown (gfm), and can be used just like our google docs document, but allows us to keep the stuff in the same place (and more important in our local git repo on our own computer)

[Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) is pretty awesome
