# Retina by *Deepmagic*
In case you guys didn't know.  This README.md is github flavored markdown (gfm), and can be used just like our google docs document, but allows us to keep the stuff in one place (and more importantly in our local git repo on our own computer)

[Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) is pretty awesome
