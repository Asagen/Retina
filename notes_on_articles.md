## Ideas while reading
- change three color layers of image with layers = number of features preprocessed. 


## Concerning *Algorithms for the autmoated dtection of deiabetic retinopathy using digital fundus images - A review*

- I think fig. 1 is important, it shows what humans look for.
    + macula "a stain, spot, or thickening; in anatomy, an area distinguishable by color or otherwise from its surroundings. Often used alone to refer to the macula retinae."
    + microaneurysm "A minute aneurysmal dilation of arteries, arterioles or capillaries"  Basically a little sac on the blood vessels
    + Exudate "fluid, cells, or other substances that have been slowly exuded, or discharged, from cells or blood vessels through small pores or breaks in cell membranes. Perspiration, pus, and serum are sometimes identified as exudates"
    + Optic disc "a small oval-shaped area on the retina marking the site of entrance into the eyeball of the optic nerve"  remember the blindspot
- This article is mainly important because of its references

## Concerning *A new approach for color distorted region removal in diabetic retinpathy detection*
- This article concerns removing the noise due to shadows and reflections.  Possibly their supposed method will be useful, but it will be too much work to implement it. 

## Concerning *Application of higher order spectra for the identificaiton of diabetes retinopathy stages*
- This articles uses SVM, but their discussion on preprocessing is useful 
- They primarily focus on image contrast improvement based on histogram equalization. Histogram equalization assigns the intensity values of
pixels in the input image such that the output image
contains a uniform distribution of intensities.

## Concerning *A Survey on Blood Vessel detection Methodologies
in Retinal Images*
- Concerns blood vessel segmentation
- Key words. Gabor wavelet and Start netwroked Pixel tracking. 
- They do some pretty cool segmentation but again, seems like too much work.  Also there's a lot rough mistakes in the article -- should be more professional. 

## Concerning *Edge Sharpening for Diabetic Retinopathy Detection
*
- Concerns segmentation of exudates
- They get benefits of converting rgb to YIQ " Form this process, the resulting image shows
improvement in color saturation and contrast between lesions
and background.   The proposed color model shows the most
suitable component for retinal image analysis. "
- Edge sharpening 
    1.  blahb blha 
    2. I will do this.  This article seems manageble and useful.
